# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

We are working at PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company. Our job is to analyze and create several types of visualizations to best illustrate data contained in large CSV files.

### Purpose

The analysis and visualizations produced will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Process

We used Python, Panda's libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.
