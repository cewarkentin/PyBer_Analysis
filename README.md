# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

We are working at PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company. Our job is to analyze and create several types of visualizations to best illustrate data contained in large CSV files.

### Purpose

The analysis and visualizations produced will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Process

We used Python, Panda's libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.

## Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

### PyBer Ride-Sharing Data

The figure below represents the total number of rides completed in each city compared to the average fare for those rides. The cicle size correlates with driver count per city. Different colors are used to indicate whether the city is considered urban, suburban, or rural.

While there is some overlap in total number of rides based on city type, generally the number of rides per city increases as the cities increase in population and activity (i.e. moving from rural cities to suburban cities to urban cities). Additionally, as the total number of rides increases, the average fare generally decreases. Because of the relationship between total number of rides, average fare, and city type, it also appears that as areas progress from rural to suburban to urban, the average fare also generally decreases.

### Total Fare by City Type

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
